## What is CornerStore?

CornerStore is an open source NFT marketplace built by Rarible DAO using the Rarible Protocol. Prosopo has forked and modified the marketplace to work with [OpenBrush's PSP34 contracts](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/examples/psp34). The PSP34 contracts have also been modified so that they are protected by Prosopo's human verification system.
